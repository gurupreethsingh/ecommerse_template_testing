`MyOrders.jsx` page scenarios.

---

  1. Page Load and Initial State

   Verify that the page loads successfully with the heading `My Orders`.
   If the user is not logged in, verify that the orders are not fetched.
   If the user is logged in but has no orders:

   Show message: `No orders placed yet.`
   Animated `FaClock` icon is shown.
   If the user has orders:

   Render a list of order cards.

---

  2. Order Card Rendering

   For each order:

     Display Order ID.
     Display order status as a colored badge:

     `"Delivered"` → green
     `"Shipped"` → blue
     anything else → yellow
     Display each item in a grid:

     Product image
     Product name
     Quantity
     Line total (price × quantity)

---

  3. Cart Items in Each Order

   Check that:

   The product image loads (with fallback on error).
   Product name is visible and correct.
   Quantity and total price are displayed correctly.
   Image and details are wrapped in `border` and `rounded` classes.

---

  4. Billing & Shipping Addresses

   Each order must show:

   Billing Address: full formatted string.
   Shipping Address: full formatted string.
   If any address field is missing, it should show "N/A" or be gracefully skipped.

---

  5. Total Price Calculation

   Check the total amount (`order.totalAmount.toFixed(2)`) is displayed at the bottom of each order card.
   Verify price is prefixed with ₹ and uses the orange-colored icon.

---

  6. Track Delivery Button

   Each order has a `Track Delivery` button.

   Text: `Track Delivery`
   Icon: `FaShippingFast`
   Should have `hover:underline` and be clickable.
   \Optional You can later link this to a tracking modal or route.

---

  7. Image Fallback

   Simulate an invalid image path.
   Verify that a placeholder image (`https://via.placeholder.com/150`) is loaded.

---

  8. Responsive Layout

   On large screens:

   Items are shown in 3-column grid.
   On medium (tablet) screens:

   Switches to 2-column layout.
   On mobile:

   Becomes single-column grid for order items.

---

  9. Edge Case Tests

   Orders with:

   No items (should still render, but show nothing in grid).
   Missing address fields.
   Status that is not Delivered/Shipped (e.g. “Processing”).
   Orders with high item quantities and multiple items.

---

  10. Animations & Styling

   Confirm animated class `animate-fadeIn` applies on page load.
   Each order card uses hover effect (`hover:shadow-xl`).
   Icons use correct colors:

   `FaBoxOpen` → orange
   `FaRupeeSign` → orange
   `FaClock` → yellow
   `FaShippingFast` → blue

---

  Suggested Test Selectors

If you want cleaner automation, consider adding `data-testid` attributes:

```jsx
<div data-testid="order-card">...</div>
<p data-testid="order-id">{order._id}</p>
<p data-testid="total-amount">₹{order.totalAmount.toFixed(2)}</p>
```

---

  End-to-End User Flow Test

1. Login as user who has orders.
2. Navigate to `/my-orders`.
3. Verify:

    Orders are rendered.
    Product details and prices are correct.
    Click “Track Delivery” (if hooked to tracking feature).
4. Logout → reload `/my-orders` → should not fetch orders.
