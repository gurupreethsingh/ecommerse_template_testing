--- Shop all page scenarios

##  1. **Page Load & Initial Render**

*   Verify that the shop page loads without errors.
*   Confirm the presence of the header "Our Products".
*   Verify that filters sidebar is visible on large screens.
*   Confirm that products are loaded and displayed.
*   Validate that the animated "toast message" area is hidden initially.

---

##  2. **Product View Modes (Grid, Card, List)**

*   Click the **Grid View** button and confirm that products are rendered in grid layout.
*   Click the **Card View** button and confirm that products are rendered in card layout.
*   Click the **List View** button and confirm that products are rendered in list layout.
*   Verify the view mode changes with appropriate UI transformation.

---

##  3. **Filtering Functionality**

*   Apply a filter (category/price/brand/etc.) and verify the product list updates.
*   Clear filters and verify the full product list is shown.
*   Check that the pagination resets to page 1 on applying a filter.
*   Verify filtered product count label is updated (e.g., `(12 items)`).

---

##  4. **Wishlist Functionality**

*   Try adding a product to wishlist as a **logged-out** user – ensure a login prompt is shown.
*   Login, then:

  *   Click the wishlist icon – confirm product is added.
  *   Click again – confirm product is removed.
  *   Check toast message is shown for both add and remove.
*   Confirm correct wishlist icon status (filled or not) after toggling.

---

##  5. **Add to Cart Functionality**

*   Click the "Add to Cart" button for a product in stock – confirm item is added.
*   Try to add an out-of-stock product – confirm error toast is shown.
*   Add multiple items and check cart count updates (if visible in the UI).

---

##  6. **Pagination Behavior**

*   Confirm correct number of products per page (based on view mode).
*   Navigate to next/previous pages – verify product list updates accordingly.
*   Check first and last page navigation.
*   Try to navigate when only one page exists – pagination should be hidden or disabled.

---

##  7. **Animation Tests (Optional but Useful)**

*   Verify that animated toast message appears when a product is added/removed from wishlist.
*   Confirm it disappears after 2 seconds.
*   Ensure sidebar and main area fade-in on page load.

---

##  8. **Responsiveness & Layout**

*   Resize window to mobile view – verify that layout adapts:

  *   Sidebar collapses (if applicable).
  *   Product views render correctly.
  *   Buttons remain clickable and visible.

---

##  9. **API Failure Handling**

*   Simulate backend API failure (e.g., turn off server) and check:

  *   Appropriate error is logged in console.
  *   No crash occurs on frontend.

---

##  10. **Edge Cases**

*   Test with zero products – verify proper empty state message.
*   Test with exactly `productsPerPage` items – pagination should be hidden.
*   Test with one product – layout should still render correctly.

---

##  Bonus: Integration Tests (if you extend scope)

*   End-to-end test: login → filter → add to wishlist → add to cart → go to checkout.
*   Wishlist persistence: reload the page and ensure wishlist items are remembered.
