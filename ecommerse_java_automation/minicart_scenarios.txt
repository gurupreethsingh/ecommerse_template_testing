 `MiniCart.jsx` component**.

---

## ✅ 1. **MiniCart Icon & Badge**

* [ ] Verify the cart icon is visible with class `FaShoppingCart`.
* [ ] When cart is empty, no red badge should be shown.
* [ ] When items exist in the cart, a red badge appears:

  * [ ] Badge shows correct count (sum of quantities).
  * [ ] Badge animates (bounce animation).

---

## ✅ 2. **Open & Close MiniCart Popup**

* [ ] Click cart icon → minicart dropdown should appear.
* [ ] Click outside the popup → minicart should close.
* [ ] Add or remove item → popup should auto-close (due to `useEffect` on cartItems).
* [ ] Popup has a smooth animation (test visible/hidden states).

---

## ✅ 3. **Empty Cart UI**

* [ ] When cart is empty:

  * [ ] Show message: `Your cart is empty!`
  * [ ] Show cart icon inside the popup (gray, centered).
  * [ ] No View Cart or Checkout buttons visible.

---

## ✅ 4. **Cart Items Rendering**

* [ ] When cart has items:

  * [ ] Each item has:

    * Image with fallback.
    * Product name.
    * Price × quantity.
    * Remove (trash) button.
* [ ] Click remove → item is removed from popup.
* [ ] Scroll area works if more than 4 items (`max-height: 80`).

---

## ✅ 5. **Total Price Calculation**

* [ ] Verify that total at bottom is correct: sum of `selling_price × quantity`.
* [ ] Confirm format: ₹ sign + `.toFixed(2)` formatting.

---

## ✅ 6. **Navigation Buttons**

* [ ] **View Cart**:

  * [ ] Appears when cart has items.
  * [ ] Clicking it navigates to `/cart` and closes the popup.
* [ ] **Checkout**:

  * [ ] Appears when cart has items.
  * [ ] Clicking it navigates to `/checkout` and closes the popup.

---

## ✅ 7. **Responsive Behavior**

* [ ] On smaller screen sizes:

  * [ ] Popup aligns to right edge.
  * [ ] Content remains scrollable.
  * [ ] Buttons are easily tappable.

---

## ✅ 8. **Image Fallback**

* [ ] Simulate broken image URL → verify that placeholder loads in its place.

---

## ✅ 9. **Framer Motion Animation**

* [ ] Verify dropdown popup uses animation on appear and disappear:

  * `initial: { opacity: 0, y: -10 }`
  * `animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }`
  * `exit: { opacity: 0, y: -10 }`

---

## 🧪 Optional Edge Cases

* [ ] Add a very high quantity item → badge should still display total correctly.
* [ ] Remove the last item in cart → popup should refresh and show “Cart is empty!” message.
* [ ] Rapid add/remove → ensure popup doesn't flicker or break animation.

---

## ✅ End-to-End Flow Test

1. Add product from `Shop`.
2. Open MiniCart → verify badge, item info, and total.
3. Click `View Cart` → land on `/cart`, verify item persists.
4. Repeat, then click `Checkout` → land on `/checkout`.

## 🧪 Suggested `data-testid` Attributes

To ease test writing and reduce brittle selectors:

```jsx
<button data-testid="minicart-toggle">...</button>
<div data-testid="minicart-popup">...</div>
<span data-testid="minicart-badge">{cartCount}</span>
```
